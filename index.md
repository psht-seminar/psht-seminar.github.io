### Aim
The theory of persistence was developed in the early 2000’s as an attempt to define topological descriptors of datasets which are stable to noise.
The aim of this seminar is to gather together the mathematical communities who have a common interest in the theoretical aspects of persistence, such as its connections to sheaf theory, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, representation theory, and relative homological algebra.
