### Aim
The theory of *persistence* was developed in the early 2000’s as an attempt to define topological descriptors of datasets which are stable to noise---the so-called *barcodes*.
Persistence theory has now been studied and used in different mathematical contexts: homotopy theory, sheaves, symplectic geometry...
The aim of this seminar is to gather together the mathematical communities who have a common interest in the theoretical aspects of persistence.
